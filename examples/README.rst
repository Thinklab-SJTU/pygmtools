Examples Gallery
=================

Below is the gallery of ``pygmtools`` examples. We build the examples from the introduction of graph matching
to the variants of graph matching, and finally, we provide examples on the applications of graph matching.
In each topic, we provide examples on different numerical backends (e.g., pytorch, numpy, paddle, jittor).

.. warning::

    The examples are under construction. Will be updated very soon.
